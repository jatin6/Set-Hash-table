HOW A SET WORKS:

Steps for building the set:

1. Calculate total ASCII value of each word in the set
	The total number of different ASCII values required is the base that will be used
	So, in this example, 52
	Multiply each character's ASCII value by the power of 52, depending on its position
	Add the total
	
2. Know the total number of slots/spaces/rows in the table
	Calculate (total from step 1) mod (number of rows in the table)

3. Insert the item at step 2's answer's location in the table

What happens when searching the set:

1. The program calculates step 1 and step 2 for the string to be searched

2. It then goes to that location in the table

3. It searches through all of the values at that location in the table
	There is the possibility that nothing is present there

4. Return true if found, otherwise false

Therefore, number of steps for building the set is O(n). The number of steps for searching the set is O(1) on average.
The number of steps for searching an array is O(n) on average.
